DEMO EXPLANATION
• This demonstration is straightforward as it encompasses an object identifier which can
distinguish between 79 classes of common objects (ranging from animals to household objects).
• The video footage from the drone's camera however is used to identify these classes.
• For this demonstration, the Tello will not be flying, hence it can be moved around and used
for outdoor or limited space events.


TO DO BEFORE
• Place a new fully charged battery inside the designated Tello and press the power button
fixed on the side once.
• The person running the code should then start the ’tello-demos’ directory in PyCharm and
open the ’object-detection.py’ file within the ’object-detection’ folder.
• The person running the code should then connect to the Wi-Fi named ’TELLO-F0B001’.


TO DO WHILE
• Once everything is in place, click within the aforementioned python script once and then
press the green triangle at the right side of the top bar to run the code. Before running the
code, ensure that the drop-down menu placed to the left of the green triangle has the value
of ’Current File’.
• Once the code started, the drones camera footage will be fed back to your computer. Within the
footage, the code is able to identify 79 common objects which appear highlighted in the video.
• To stop the script, click on the red rectangle at the right side of the top bar once.


TO DO AFTER
• Once the script stopped running, approach the Tello and press the power button on its edge
once to power it off.
• Remove the battery and let it cool down before recharging it.
