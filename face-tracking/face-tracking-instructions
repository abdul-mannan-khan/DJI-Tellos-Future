DEMO EXPLANATION
• This demonstration showcases the capabilities of the Tello to identify and track faces and
gestures.
• Once the activity has started, the Tello will follow the biggest face it can see (equivalent
to the closest face to its camera) to try to keep a constant distance to it and try to put the
centre of the identified face within the centre of the image it provides.
• Gesture controls can further be used to send simple commands to the drone with further explanations
below.


TO DO BEFORE
• Pick the marked single Tello EDU and place a fully charged new battery inside it.
• Start the Tello EDU by pressing once on the button found on the side of the drone.


TO DO BEFORE (person leading the engagement activity)
• Place yourself inside the nets and 3-4 metres in front of the Tello EDU (if you are too close, the
Tello might pick up non-existing gestures when ascending). It might also be beneficial to position yourself
out of the camera view of the drone before the Tello reaches its initial altitude.
• Ensure the Tello EDU camera is directly facing you.
• Ensure you wear safety glasses.
• Ensure there are no other people in the vicinity (the Tello EDU might pick up on their faces
and start following them in the case it does not identify your face). The gesture identification
happens to be extremely potent hence it can easily pick up on the gestures of the audience behind,
hence ideally place yourself with an empty background behind you.


TO DO BEFORE (person running the code)
• Place yourself outside the nets at the designated computer.
• Open the ’tello-demos’ directory using PyCharm.
• In this directory, open the ’face-tracking-with-gestures.py’ file within the ’face-tracking’ folder.
• Connect to the Wi-Fi named ’TELLO-F0B001’.
• Wait for the person leading the engagement activity to finish all their ’TO DO BEFORE’
tasks.


TO DO WHILE (person running the code)
• Once the person leading the activity has completed their first set of tasks, while having
the ’face-tracking-with-gestures.py’ file opened, run the code by pressing the green triangle set in
the right side of the top bar. Remember to click anywhere within the python script before
running the code to ensure the proper file is running. Before running the code, ensure that
the drop-down menu placed to the left of the green triangle has the value of ’Current File’.
• The Tello EDU will then take-off, and the camera footage of the drone will be fed back to
the person at the computer. Within the camera feed, each identified face will be shown by a
red rectangle with a green dot representing the centre of each face.
• Closely monitor the camera feed and in case the Tello seems to malfunction (likely by identi-
fying and following a different face than the person’s leading the engagement activity), click
on the red rectangle from the right side of the top bar to terminate the code and advice the person
leading the activity to step away from the drone.
• Once the Tello EDU has landed, stop the code by pressing the red rectangle at the right side
of the top bar. To run the code again, follow the same exact steps.


TO DO WHILE (person leading the engagement activity)
• Once the person running the code started the script, the drone will be taking off and climbing
to a predefined altitude (to make it easier to pick up faces).
• Once that altitude has been reached, the Tello EDU will identify your face and start following
it by ensuring the centre of your face is always at the centre of the video footage and that the
area of your face is within a predefined limit.
• Avoid any fast or jerky movements which might make the Tello unable to identify your face
or result in drone oscillations. Move slowly and always wait for the Tello to settle to a close
to zero velocity after each movement.
• There are 4 possible gestures that the Tello EDU responds to with each of them described in
detail below.
• First one is raising your left hand (the wrist of your left hand has to be above your nose base
and close to your face so it can be picked up by the camera) which makes the drone go right
(your left). Second one is raising your right hand (identical process to the raising your left
hand) which makes the Tello go left (your right). Ensure that when raising one hand, the
other one is below your nose base.
• Third gesture is raising both hands (defined as raising both wrists above your nose base and
close to your face) which makes the drone flip backwards. This is only possible if the battery
of the drone is higher than 50%. After flipping, the drone will take a couple of seconds until
it can follow you again. Do not do it repeatedly as it puts a high strain on the drone and may
affect communications. If the flip command is given when the drone is below 50%, then the
Tello will not respond and will further need to be manually rebooted by powering it off and on.
• Fourth gesture is to be used only at the very end of the engagement activity as it makes the
drone land and ends the scripts. To perform it, have your wrists below the base of your nose
and cross you arms in an X such that the left wrist is right to your nose base and the right
wrist is left to your nose base.
• If any gesture is not picked up by the Tello, try performing it closer to your face.
• Avoid performing any of these gesture by mistake!
• When the Tello is executing a gesture command, it stops tracking your face, hence ensure
that after completing its tasks, the drone’s camera is still able to pick up your face.


TO DO AFTER
• Once the drone has successfully landed and the script stopped running, approach the Tello
and press the power button on its edge once.
• Remove the battery and let it cool down before recharging it and place the Tello in a secure
location.


KEEP IN MIND
• This demo is prone to fail under communication error due to either poor Wi-fi connection, poor
device compatibility or Wi-Fi interference (the demo was tested on a Windows device, you might find
that a Linux device does not encounter these problems / this was also tested within the BRL flight
arena with strong Wi-Fi interference from the multiple existing networks within the lab).
• This is due to the high computational demands that come with the task and the failure usually consists
of the video footage from the drone freezing and the Tello looping through its last position command (the
code gives commands to the Tello in the form of speeds in all directions at each timestep). The drone
might hence be seen to drift and pose a risk to the participants. If this happens, immediately stop running
the code and wait for the Tello to settle and land before interfering.
