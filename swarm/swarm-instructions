TO DO BEFORE
• Place the 8 mission pads in the formation presented in the attached pdf file within the 'swarm'
folder. The ID of each mission pad is written on itself. The positive direction X of a mission
pad is given by the direction in which the rocket on the pad (top right) is pointing towards.
• The distance between pad 1 and 2, 2 and 3, 3 and 4, and 4 and 1 should be kept constant
at 1 metre. Pads 5, 6, 7, 8 are to be placed 1 metre away from the closest edge of the inner
rectangle created by pads 1, 2, 3 and 4. They are also to be placed in the middle of these
edges. Pad 5 will hence be 1 metre forwards to pad 1 and 2 and half a metre to the right of
pad 1 and half a metre to the left of pad 2. A similar pattern is seen in the placement of pads
6, 7 and 8, creating a diamond-like shape. Ensure the distance of 1 metre and a half a metre is
closely followed.
• Insert a fully charged battery in all 4 of the unmarked Tello EDUs and then start each one of
them by pressing the power button on their edges once. Avoid holding the button down for
a long period of time (around 5 seconds) as this disconnects the drone from the router and it
needs to be manually connected back (refer to 'connecting-swarm-to-router' file).
• Place the 4 drones on pads 1, 2, 3 and 4 respectively with each of them facing towards the
positive X direction.
• The person running the code should then start the ’tello-demos’ directory in PyCharm and
open the ’swarm-dance.py’ file within the ’swarming’ folder.
• Ensure the Tello EDUs are already in AP mode (consult "-connect-swarm-to-router") and, if wanted,
follow the guidelines presented in line 143 of "swarm-dance" to design your own choreography.
• The person should then connect to the Wi-Fi of the router used.


TO DO WHILE
• Once everything is in place, click within the aforementioned python script once and then
press the green triangle at the right side of the top bar to run the code. Before running the
code, ensure that the drop-down menu placed to the left of the green triangle has the value
of ’Current File’.
• Once the code has started, the drones will execute the built-in choreography.
• If anything unforeseen happens, manually stop the drones by clicking the red rectangle at
the right of the top bar.
• Additional information on building a unique choreography is presented in the python script
in the form of commented lines.
• If not all drones are responding, best approach is to manually turn them on and off again.


TO DO AFTER
• Once all the drones have landed, turn each one of them off by pressing their power button
on the side once.
• Remove the batteries and wait for them cool down before recharging.
• Remove the mission pads from the area to clear the space and place the drones in a secure
location.
