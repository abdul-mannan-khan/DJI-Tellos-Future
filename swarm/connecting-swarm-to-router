CONNECTING SWARM TO ROUTER
• Open the tello-demos directory, and then enter the swarm folder and open the python file
'set-ap-mode.py'. Follow the instructions in the file and put the SSID and password of the router
in the last line.
• Sequentially, connect via Wi-Fi to each individual Tello drone and then run the 'set-ap-mode.py' script by pressing
the green triangle at the right side of the top bar. If a message saying 'the drone will reboot' appears,
then the drone was successfully connected to the router and entered AP mode.
• To disconnect a drone from the router or make it leave AP mode, hold the power button for more than 5
seconds. If the drone successfully disconnected, then, after powering the drone again, you should be able
to see its Wi-Fi network (a drone in AP mode does not emit its own Wi-Fi).
• After connecting all the needed drones to the router, go into your net browser and type the IP address
of the router in the search bar. This will then send you to the router page.
• The next step varies with the company that made the router, but basically you need to find a section called
the DCHP server (this dynamically offers IP addresses to the devices connected to the router). For most
routers, you need to click on 'LAN' from the side bar and then go into the 'DCHP' section.
• Within the DCHP page, all the devices connected to your router will be presented. Find the Tello
EDUs and proceed to give them a static IP address and save it (this ensures that while they are connected
to the router, they will always have the same IP address). The process should be straightforward as there
are usually instructions at the bottom of the DCHP page.
• If the Tello EDUs however are not immediately identified by the router, rebooting the router is likely
to help. Remember if you can't see the Wi-Fi of the drone when it is powered on, then it is most likely
already connected to the router, but it is just not displayed on the device page.
• After this, go into the "swarm-dance.py" file from the "swarm" folder within the "tello-demos"
directory and, onto line 14, input the static IP addresses that you have given your Tellos, based
on the instructions displayed in the comments.


DISCONNECT DRONE FROM ROUTER
• In order to disconnect a drone from the router, press the power button on the side of the Tello and
hold it for more than 5 seconds. If successful, the drone will start emitting its own Wi-Fi network.
• Afterwards, the drone can be run individually or the process of connecting it to the router can be
repeated.
